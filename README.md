# Ingenia style guide

This repository defines a set of conventions about how to write code for Ingenia projects.

Every project/repository should include its own codification rules.

> There is not a best codification rule. It just helps all the team understand easily the code of the other coworkers. Therefore, the developer must apply the codification rule specified in the project where it is working.
